So, this is my first blog post here on [lars.tijhuis.blog] and I am actually writing this while I should be going to bed. However, I couldn't help myself and needed to get this blog set-up right before we (Sanne and I) are leaving for New Zealand tomorrow! I wanted to start blogging again for quite some time now, and this was the perfect possibility having planned a 5 week trip.

So to quickly summarize (I actually am pretty tired): First we'll be heading for Sydney, making a 2 hour stop in Dubai. In Sydney we'll be visiting Sanne's family who have been living abroad for some time now. Here we can come to rest from some weeks of hard work before heading for Christchurch on Friday 2nd of December. From there on we'll be covering most of New Zealand in a rented Mobile home, doing hikes and enjoying the camping life!

I will need to figure out how I am going to keep this blog updated while travelling, as I will not be bringing my laptop. I think I won't have time to figure it out though and will just have to stick with my backup plan of writing them on my phone (or old fashioned paper) and post them later.. Ok, time for bed now.

Oh, by the way, we are using [Polarsteps] to keep track of our trip. Probably best to post the pics and find the related stories on our personal page here: [https://www.polarsteps.com/LarsTijhuis/53511-new-zealand]
