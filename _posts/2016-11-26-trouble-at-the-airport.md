Making a 5 week trip requires some upfront planning and preparing. *What places do we want to visit? What flights should we take? And how will we get around?* Sanne and I planned to visit the southern island of New Zealand first, as we will be spending most of our trip on the bigger island with more mountains to hike. Thus, a flight to Christchurch was what we needed.

Flying from Amsterdam to Christchurch required us to do two transfers. Sydney, Hong Kong and Dubai among the layover options. Since doing three flights in a row wasn't really tempting to us, we figured to stay a couple of days in Sydney! So, we booked our flights, contacted Mark and Margot to make sure we could stay a couple of nights at their place and it was all settled. In the weeks to follow we made a travel plan ([one](https://www.google.nl/maps/dir/28+Sheffield+Cres,+Burnside,+Christchurch+8053,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Mount+Cook,+Canterbury,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Te+Anau,+Southland,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Milford+Sound,+Southland,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Queenstown,+Otago,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Fox+Glacier,+West+Coast,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Franz+Josef+Glacier,+West+Coast,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Abel+Tasman+National+Park,+Tasman,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Blenheim,+Marlborough,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Wellington,+Nieuw-Zeeland/@-43.2164201,169.043475,7z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m62!4m61!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d31f4b549ff507f:0x3b2f7a037e20102e!2m2!1d172.5615245!2d-43.4904051!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d2a533ff2ab8e63:0x500ef86847990d0!2m2!1d170.1221376!2d-43.9105155!1m5!1m1!1s0xa9d46d2095665e6b:0x500ef868479b450!2m2!1d167.718053!2d-45.4144515!1m5!1m1!1s0xa9d60bbf3c7ff175:0x500ef8684798ea0!2m2!1d167.9256213!2d-44.671625!1m5!1m1!1s0xa9d51df1d7a8de5f:0x500ef868479a600!2m2!1d168.6626435!2d-45.0311622!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d2a2f858f40eafd:0x500ef8684796e70!2m2!1d170.0175878!2d-43.4644799!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d297e26ef2fb437:0x500ef8684796ec0!2m2!1d170.1832884!2d-43.3873293!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d3c87733a97ce75:0x500ef868479ce90!2m2!1d173.0013919!2d-40.8223808!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d390e0080e269bd:0xa00ef88e796a530!2m2!1d173.9612498!2d-41.5134425!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d38b1fc49e974cb:0xa00ef63a213b470!2m2!1d174.776236!2d-41.2864603!3e0?hl=nl	) and [two](https://www.google.nl/maps/dir/Wellington,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Mount+Taranaki,+Egmont+National+Park,+Taranaki,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Tongariro+National+Park,+Waikato,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Taupo,+Waikato,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Rotorua,+Plentybaai,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Waitomo+Caves+Road,+Waitomo,+Nieuw-Zeeland/Bay+Of+Islands,+Paihia,+Northland,+Nieuw-Zeeland/60+Walls+Road,+Penrose,+Auckland,+Nieuw-Zeeland/@-38.1946436,170.726659,6z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m50!4m49!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d38b1fc49e974cb:0xa00ef63a213b470!2m2!1d174.776236!2d-41.2864603!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d15b0517747d98d:0xb4bd6905b2ed0ef9!2m2!1d174.0633993!2d-39.2967702!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d6ba4f1d9dc9d21:0x500ef6143a33440!2m2!1d175.7349656!2d-39.0119995!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d6bef77144b165b:0x500ef6143a309e0!2m2!1d176.0702098!2d-38.6856924!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d6e983d82f6b22b:0x500ef6143a39931!2m2!1d176.2497461!2d-38.1368478!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d6cb8533ed79e71:0x30f1363c99d89f9d!2m2!1d175.1453425!2d-38.2619327!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d0bbaf0bf40d3d9:0x2a00ef61665981f0!2m2!1d174.0682753!2d-35.274137!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d0d48dc80f966c5:0xfdaee41d78d20660!2m2!1d174.8071164!2d-36.9105218!3e0?hl=nl)) based on our Lonely Planet, Google work, and stories from others. Also, we booked our own [Spaceship](http://www.spaceshipsrentals.co.nz) to fly around the island. All was settled. Or so we thought..

During preparation we were focusing on our NZ trip, feeling that the Sydney part would be figured out while we were there. So this morning we left The Hague, heading for the airport. Of course, not without taking our traditional "waiting for the bus"-picture:

![Sanne and I have this picture from every trip we made since living in The Hague](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/bochj8opxcdvxnm/Photo%2026-11-2016%2C%2021%2006%2056.jpg)

*Did you two arrange a Visa for Australia?* 

The question made my heart pound. *Oh #%$&!* How could've we been so stupid? We did check Visa requirements for NZ, but somehow managed to forget about the strict Visa policies in Australia. I could imagine this happening to me, but Sanne as well? (she is always prepared, lucky me). Guess it is proof of too hard work in the last couple of weeks (which also led to us postponing packing our bags until 1am last night).

Luckily enough, the ETA could be arranged within minutes, if it wasn't for the lady at the counter spelling an "8" instead of a "B" for Sanne's passport number. Now it took us 20 minutes, which was ok since we were early anyway. So after a coffee with the loving parents, we were ready to take of in our huge ass A380!

Currently we're up high in the sky, heading for Sydney with a 2 hour layover in Dubai. I figured out this morning to look for an App to do some blogging, and I came across [Octopage](https://appsto.re/nl/rk9UM.i). Pretty neat app! I already found some possible improvements though, which bothered me while writing this post: no markdown highlighting, the editor is not working too well when rotating the screen (text falls off) and no options to easily add pictures to my posts. Being new to Jekyll and GitHub pages, I am not sure if it was designed to be used with pictures, but I will be adding some for sure! (ah, [found it](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) on the first page already).

I also got my domain names assigned now and changed the DNS records to accommodate this blog under the cool <http://Lars.Tijhuis.blog> URL! Now let's wait for the naming servers to pick up the new records.

Heading back to the on-board movies. Just watched one from my all time favorite trilogy's: Star Wars! Best. Flight. Ever.
