As you might have guessed from the name of this blog; I am Lars, born in 1987 and currently living with my girlfriend Sanne in The Hague, the Netherlands. I am a former computer science student from Delft University of Technology, where I got my engineering (or MSc if you may) degree. Since 2014, I have been working at KPMG as a (now senior) Consultant.

I started this blog as I have always loved to write stories. Stories on what keeps me busy in my personal life, which I now want to expand to my professional life as well. So, besides stories on what adventures I have been on during my last holidays, you will also find articles on cool technologies in the areas that I focus on or am currently playing around with in my spare time. Think (cloud) architecture and infrastructure, software (quality/development) related topics, data analytics, Internet of Things, and automating our home.

Another reason to start this blog is that I recently picked up the phrase *"If you want to become an expert on a topic, write a book about it"*. Now I don't plan on writing any books; as I am more the agile kind of guy, I will start writing blog posts! I have been doing a lot of work in the Microsoft Azure field lately and felt that I need to share my knowledge on the topic (among others). Also, I think it will motivate me to keep on learning by writing articles on topics I want to know more about.

So, expect some articles from me soon!
